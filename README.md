 
#### **JSON Patch** is a format for describing changes to a JSON document. It can be used to store changes in the form of patch operations. The patch documents are themselves JSON documents. JSON Patch is specified in RFC 6902 from the IETF.

#### This little code snippet does the following.
-   Displays the diff between the original json and the patch operations.
-   Allows the user to approve / reject one patch operation at a time
-   Updates the UI after each approve / reject.
